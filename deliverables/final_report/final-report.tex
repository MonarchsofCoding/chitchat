\chapter{Introduction}

Chat systems refers to communication over the Internet, communication that offers a real-time transmission of messages from sender to receiver(s). There are many types of messages such as texts, multi-media, etc. In this project, we have been developing a reliable, secure, real-time, distributed chat system where users can exchange messages among each other. Our application can be accessed using PCs and Android mobile phones.\\ \\
The system is made of three sub-systems mainly, which are: A server written in Elixir, a Java Desktop application, and an Android application. With a friendly graphical user interface.
At the beginning of the work, we defined several features that our system should deliver, some of them were priorities so the system can deliver a basic communication, the others were non-priorities which we could achieve some and left some for future work. \\

\section{Priority Features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Registering New Profile.
		\item Sign-in Process.
		\item Contacts Look-up.
  		\item Exchanging Text Messages.
 		\item Listing Existing Chats.
		\item Chats History.
		\item Sign-out Process.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Non-priority Features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deleting Existing Chats.
		\item Managing a User's Profile.
		\item Participation in Group Chats.
		\item Exchangin Multimedia Messages.
\end{itemize}
\\ \\
The whole developing process was made using Agile development methodology, we had several steps to develop every feature, starting from \emph {Backlog} which contains the ideas and sub ideas, \emph {Specify} which contains the notes and criteria we should satisfy during next steps, \emph {Implement} which is the programming phase, \emph {Test/QA} where the implemented features are tested against the criteria which was set in \emph {Specify} step, and finally \emph {Deployed} which means that this feature is completed.
