## Android Client

## What do you need?
Simply, download Android Studio to your machine. During installation, do simple installation, not custom. The required SDK and tools will be downloaded by the installer itself. The setups for the project and the Android Emulator is explained below.

IDEA is ok as well, but setup for SDK and tools is not easy. Prefer Android Studio if possible.

DO NOT USE ECLIPSE TO IMPORT ANDROID STUDIO PROJECTS!

# More coming soon...
